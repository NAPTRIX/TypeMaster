A versatile and engaging python script designed to help you enhance your typing speed and accuracy.

Iâ€™ve added a Flask app to run as a web application, offering a cleaner and more interactive experience compared to the CLI version.

 Required Libraries:
1. For CLI Version:


- [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput): For keyboard input monitoring.
- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/): For playing sound effects.
- [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama): For adding color formatting to terminal output.

2. For Flask Web App:

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/): For building the web application.
You can install them using the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install pynput pygame colorama flask
